# Stereotype's Analysis

In the commercial of a cleaning product came the phrase "every woman is a diva and every man is slow (slow)," this statement caused discomfort to a group of men who, when they felt harassed, asked the National Council of Self- Regulation of Brazil to withdraw advertising. However, does the stereotype that a woman is better than a man by being able to perform various types of tasks really true? Is modern man inferior in performing activities in relation to women? I believe that the human being is able to perform a task better than the other, due to the social and cultural environment in which he lives. So to prove such a theory, I intend to use the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data on gender and jobs in the world (2018)

The main variable will be the time spended by individual of both genders in: Paid work or study
paid work (travel to and from work/study, time in school or classes, research/homework, job search and other paid work or study-related), Unpaid work (routine housework, shopping, care for household members, child care, adult care, care for non household members, volunteering, travel related to household activities, other unpaid), Personal care (sleeping, eating & drinking, personal, household, and medical services + travel related to personal care), Leisure (sports, participating / attending events, visiting or entertaining friends, TV or radio at home, Other leisure activities) and Other (religious / spiritual activities and civic obligations, other).
